Hi, I am a Postdoctoral Research Assistant working with President Joseph E. Aoun Professor <a href = 'http://eliassi.org'  style="color: DarkSlateBlue; text-decoration: none" >Tina Eliassi-Rad</a> in the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University. 
  <br/><br/>
  I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Northeastern University where I was advised by <a href = 'https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/alina/'  style="color: DarkSlateBlue; text-decoration: none" >Dr. Alina Oprea</a>. I was affiliated with the NDS2 lab and was a part of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute. During my doctoral years, my research interests were in the intersection of deep learning, network science, and cybersecurity, starting on the level of cybernetwork resilience against adversarial behavior and going to the level of evasive behavior against machine learning models in critical environments. 
  Therefore, I am interested in the mathematical modeling of self-propagating malware with a rigorous assessment of its essential characteristics and proactive methods for network resilience against it.
 Another research area that fascinates me is adversarial machine learning, where I study the effect of adversarial attacks against deep neural networks in cybersecurity and self-driving cars domains. 
  <br/><br/>
Before joining Northeastern, I received my BS degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Belarusian State University, where
  I was affiliated with the Mathematical Modeling and Data Analysis Department under the supervision of <a href = 'https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=bT04cCIAAAAJ&hl=ru'  style="color: DarkSlateBlue; text-decoration: none" >Dr. Vladimir Malugin </a>. My research focus included the design of hedging algorithms based on derivative contracts. Additionally, I was a part of the Research Institute of Applied Mathematics and Information Technology Problems, where 
  I participated in the project for credit rankings estimation and evaluation of national enterprises using mathematical, statistical, and econometric methods and
models.</p>
  
 <p>My other interests include hiking and yoga, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chromatic_film_photos/" style="color: DarkSlateBlue; text-decoration: none">film photography</a> and visual art, music and soundscapes.
